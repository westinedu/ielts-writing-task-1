For example, Italy has twice as many mobile phones as landlines, with 88 mobiles per hundred people compared to 45 for landlines.

One example is the USA, where the number of mobiles, at 50 per 100 people, is much lower than the number of landlines, at almost 70 per hundred. A similar pattern can be seen in Canada.
