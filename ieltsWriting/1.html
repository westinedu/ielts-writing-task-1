<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='background:yellow'>It is clear that
nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity generation
over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in
each year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In 1980, thermal power stations were the
main source of electricity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of
power. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt
hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. Just
one year later, nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of
electricity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Between 1980 and 2005, electricity
production from <a
href="https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/programs/masters/mba/on-campus/admissions">nuclear</a>
power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the
figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985 and remained at
this level for the rest of the period. <u>Hydroelectric power generation
remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole
32-year period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to
approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.</u></span></p>
